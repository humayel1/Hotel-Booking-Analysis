# **Project Summary** -
* The Hotel Booking Analysis project is an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing hotel booking data to extract valuable insights and make data-driven observations. The project addresses various aspects of hotel bookings, including cancellations, booking ratios between resort and city hotels, percentage of bookings per year, monthly customer counts, guest origins, average monthly rates per person, weekday versus weekend bookings, hotel availability, total bookings and revenue across years, preferred hotels and stay durations, and length of stay.

* The project begins by cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure data quality. Through data exploration and visualization, we determine the number of bookings that were cancelled and examine the factors contributing to cancellations. Next, we calculate the booking ratio between resort hotels and city hotels to understand customer preferences and identify any significant differences in booking patterns. We also analyze the percentage of bookings for each year to identify booking trends and seasonality.

* Furthermore, we investigate the monthly customer counts received by each hotel to identify peak periods and seasonal variations in customer traffic. By determining the country from which most guests come, we gain insights into customer demographics and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. The average monthly rate per person is calculated to understand pricing trends and assess the competitiveness of hotels in the market.

* Additionally, we analyze the number of bookings made on weekdays versus weekends to identify any significant differences in customer behavior and booking patterns. We also assess hotel availability for booking and provide insights to hotel managers to optimize inventory management and improve booking efficiency.

* Moreover, the project explores the total number of bookings across different years, analyzing booking growth and trends. We split the total revenue across years by hotel type to evaluate revenue trends and compare the performance of different hotel types.

* Lastly, we investigate the preferred hotels where guests like to stay and spend more time. By differentiating between weeknight and weekend stays, we gain insights into customer preferences and behavior. Additionally, we analyze the length of stay in hotels to understand typical stay durations and any correlations with factors such as hotel type or booking month.

Through comprehensive data analysis, visualization, and interpretation, this project provides valuable insights into hotel booking patterns, customer behavior, revenue trends, and guest preferences. The findings can guide strategic decision-making, marketing efforts, and overall business optimization for hotel establishments.
# Problem Statement
**Hotel industry is a very volatile industry and the bookings depend on variety of factors such as type of hotels, seasonality, days of week and many more. This makes analyzing the patterns available in the past data more important to help the hotels plan better. Using the historical data, hotels can perform various campaigns to boost the business. We can use the patterns to predict the future bookings using time series or decision trees.**

We will be using the data available to analyze the factors affecting the hotel bookings. These factors can be used for reporting the trends and predict the future bookings.

**We will be tackling this problem statement**:

1. How Many Booking Were Cancelled?
2. What is the booking ratio between Resort Hotel and City Hotel?
3. What is the percentage of booking for each year?
4. What is the monthly customers each hotel is receiving?
5. From which country most guests come?
6. What is the average monthly rate per person?
7. Number of bookings on weekday vs weekends.
8. Hotels available for booking.
9. Total bookings across years.
10. Total revenue across years split by hotel type.
11. Check in which hotel people like to stay and spend more time.
(a). We will check for the week nights stay.
(b). We will check for the weekends stay.
12. How Long People Stay in the hotel?

* **Define Your Business Objective?**
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyse the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.
